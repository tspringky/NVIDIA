- [Camel](http://camel.apache.org/) - Empowers you to define routing and mediation rules in a variety of domain-specific languages, including a Java-based Fluent API, Spring or Blueprint XML Configuration files, and a Scala DSL.

### Serialization

- [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) - Efficient binary serialization format.
- [Cereal](http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/) - C++11 library for serialization.
- [Kryo](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo) - Java serialization and cloning: fast, efficient, automatic.

### Messaging

- [ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/) - Powerful open source messaging and integration patterns server.
- [Apollo](http://activemq.apache.org/apollo/) - Faster, more reliable, easier to maintain messaging broker built from the foundations of the original ActiveMQ.
- [Qpid](https://qpid.apache.org/) - Cross-platform messaging components built on AMQP.
- [Beanstalk](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/) - Simple, fast work queue.
- [Nanomsg](http://nanomsg.org/) - Socket library that provides several common communication patterns for building distributed systems.
- [Ã˜MQ](http://zeromq.org/) - Brokerless intelligent transport layer.
- [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) - Publish-subscribe messaging rethought as a distributed commit log.
- [Disque](https://github.com/antirez/disque) - Distributed message broker.

### Data Grid

- [Hazelcast](http://hazelcast.org/) - Open source in-memory data grid.
- [Galaxy](http://www.paralleluniverse.co/galaxy/) - Open-source high-performance in-memory data-grid.

### Resilience

- [Simian Army](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy) - Suite of tools for keeping your cloud operating in top form. Chaos Monkey, the first member, is a resiliency tool that helps ensure that your applications can tolerate random instance failures.
- [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) - Latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.

### Configuration & Discovery

- [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) - Open-source server which enables highly reliable distributed coordination.
- [Etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) - Highly-available key-value store for shared configuration and service discovery.
- [SkyDNS](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns) - Distributed service for announcement and discovery of services built on top of etcd. It utilizes DNS queries to discover available services.
- [Consul](https://consul.io/) - Service discovery and configuration made easy. Distributed, highly available, and datacenter-aware.
- [Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki/Eureka-at-a-glance) - REST based service that is primarily used in the AWS cloud for locating services for the purpose of load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers.

### Monitoring
